         args has 2 strings seperated by a space:

         first string takes the form of x   

         when  x = "9S-1" --- this means the SUDOKU problem to be solved is given by the second argument:                       

                  yy = 81 digits string of SUDOKU problem.

		  parameter given in second argument:

                  d-cc   where  d is difficulty level (1 to 6)

                               cc is puzzle number

      (2)  return:

             "Ok" --   then the second to fourth strings are as described below:

         second String is "answer_ctr=x-difficulty_level=y"


                     "x" = "1" --- means the problem has a unique answer.

                     "y"       --- is problem's difficulty level.
                                   value is one of 1,2,3,4,4+,5,5+,6,6+

         Third string contains all 81 digits of the Sodoku problem and

                         81 digit answer string, with these two parts separated by a semicolon (";").

         Fourth string contains steps needed to solve the puzzle delimited by semicolons
