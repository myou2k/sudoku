        where  args has 2 string seperate with space:

        first string has type x-yy   

        when  x = "1" --- means the SUDOKU problem in second argument:                       

                  yy = 81 digits string of SUDOKU problem.

        when  x = "2" --- means the SUDOKU problem get from Server, parameter

                  gived in second argument:

                  d-cc   where  d is difficult level (1 to 6)

                               cc is relative number.

       when the command submitted, the backend give 3 strings seperated by a space,

       First string  is "answer_ctr=x-difficult_level=y"

                  if "x" = "0" --- means user gives problem has not answer,

                     "x" = "1" --- means the problem has unique answer.

                     "y"       --- is problem difficult level.

        when "x" = "1",  Second string has 81digits as problem,semicolon ";" and

                                81 answer string.

                         Three string is solve steps,each step with semicolon ended,
